"""The fair observation fields a timed log of card plays determines, with no engine.

WHAT IT IS FOR. A log of who played which card when, plus the rules everyone knows,
fixes most of what a player remembers: both elixir bars, the own hand and cycle, the
cards the opponent has shown, how long since the last play. ``PublicLogMemory`` rebuilds
those fields from such a log, so a model can be trained on a timed log of card plays
with no engine running, and read exactly the numbers the env would show.

ONE SET OF FORMULAS. It is a thin wrapper over ``MatchMemory`` in ``royalegym.obs``:
``bind`` gives it the card costs, ``start`` starts it, and ``advance`` and
``show_own_hand`` move it on (the calls the env's ``observe`` makes). The fields are
read with ``fair_fields`` (the function ``build_vector`` gets them from), on
``MatchClock.at``. Apart from the catalogue pin, what this module adds is only where
the inputs come from: plays from a log, and the own hand from the dealt deck order.

WHAT IT CANNOT FILL. The board: tower hitpoints, crowns and which kings are awake
(``BOARD_FIELDS``). A log of plays does not say what the plays did.

THE CATALOGUE PIN. Card ids are positions in the catalogue, so making one more card
loadable renumbers every later id. ``card_names`` pins the catalogue by name, and the
constructor refuses cards whose names differ from it in any way. Pass the list your run
pins (the one its config names), not one read back from the catalogue: reading it back
would make the check compare the catalogue with itself.

THE ASSUMPTIONS, EACH CHECKED AGAINST AN ENGINE IN tests/test_public_log.py:
    * a played card's hand slot takes the next card, and the played card goes to the
      back of the queue;
    * a play at tick p is paid before tick p runs and shows in any observation at a
      tick after p;
    * a match still running at the end of regulation is in overtime;
    * the elixir rate at a tick is ``ElixirLaw.rate_at``.

    """One seat's fair, non-board observation fields, kept from a timed log of plays.

    ``cards`` is the run's catalogue, in the run's order: ids are positions, and the
    one-hot fields are as wide as it is. ``deck_order`` is the seat's own eight cards
    as the match dealt them: the first four are the hand, slot by slot, and the rest
    the queue, next card first. ``card_names`` is the catalogue the run pins, by name,
    in id order. The names in ``cards`` must equal it exactly, or the constructor
    refuses before any id is read.

    Feed plays with ``own_play`` and ``enemy_play``, in any amount ahead of time, and
    read the fields with ``observe(tick)``. An observation at tick T sees exactly the
    plays made before T, as the env's does.

    ``unaffordable`` counts plays the counted bar could not pay, (own, enemy). The
    engine refuses those, so on a log an engine produced it stays (0, 0). Anywhere else
    a non-zero count means a play is missing from the log or the elixir law is not the
    one this memory counts with, and from then on the elixir fields are estimates.
